# Week 2:

Task: Writing a program that calculates sombody's Body Mass Index (BMI). 

First I have created the file for this task as bmi.py
The first input is the person's height in centimeters and the second input is the weight in kilograms. Both inputs I have type casted as float so that I can work with the decimel points.
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.

The code I have used there are shown below:

weight = float (input ("Enter weight: "))
height = float (input ("Enter height: ")) 
metersquared = (height / 100) **2
BMI = round(weight / metersquared, 2)
print("BMI is {}". format(BMI))

Learning Outcome:

* Learned how to take user input for the particular programing
* Learned how to search for a references on the web
* How to do the calculation in the programming

# Week 03

## Task: Writing a program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order
Please enter a sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
".o zletrv pu o wr cu h"


* First I have created the file for this task as secondstring.py
* In the task we have given a clue to take an user input which will be a string and
it will be sliced in a reverse way.
* Requests for a input which will be a string
* Then used the slice function in that string by [::-2] to get the expected output as the example showed in the task. 

## Code:

sentenceInput = (input ("Please enter a sentence: "))
sentencevalue = sentenceInput[::-2]
print(sentencevalue)


## Learning Outcome:

* Learned to work with a string.
* Learned to use the slice function.
* How to get back a string in a reverse way.

# Week 04

## Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
## At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one
## Have the program end if the current value is one.


* First I have created a file for this task as collatz.py
* Begening of the programm, I have created a function for an user input which will be a positive integer
* I had to convert that input to an integer, otherwise python will recognise it as a string


## Code:

n = int( input("Please input a positive integer "))
while n != 1:
if n % 2 == 0:
        n = n/2
 else:
    n = 3*n+1
print (round(n))   


## Learning Outcome:

* Learning how to use while loop and checking if the input (n) is not equelty one by the while loop
* Being introduced with the if/else statements in the following lines
* Using the if statement to check the number even or odd by dividing by two
* Using the else statement if the number is odd which will be multiplied by three and added one 
* At the end, using the round method and printing the results
